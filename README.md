# StaffAlert for Minecraft

Hello everyone!

Hello, I'm a former client/script developer who was feeling bored, so I decided to update my StaffAlert, which I created back in 2020.

Here are the new features that I have added:

You can now add users through commands (although I'm still working on programming it to save the users).
Updated to the new API version.
Customization of text position.
Added AutoHub.
Improved code.

Here's how it looks:

To add more users and save them, you need to edit the "staffMembers" variable.
To add users through commands, you can use the "StaffAdd nick" or "Staff nick" commands (remember that the nicknames are saved temporarily).

Here's an example of how to use the command:
